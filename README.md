# AWS Course 2020 at IT HÃ¶gskolan
***

The source code in the current repo composes more or *less* completed **Lab 2**. The application endpoint is magically served at AWS S2 static web hosting [here. ](http://twaddle-frontend-react.s3-website.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/)
<br>
An old endpoint **Lab 1** on EC2 is still [here.](http://ec2-13-53-32-253.eu-north-1.compute.amazonaws.com/)
<br>

## Technologies used
AWS Services: S3, Lambda (unwilling to cooperate!), Cloudformation, API Gateways, EC2 with Ubuntu and Postgres
<br>
